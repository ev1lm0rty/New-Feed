Entrepreneurs are using digital technologies to finance innovation (Ahrens et al. 2019; Audretsch et al. 2016; Fisch 2019) or create new digital products, services, and business models. These activities are called digital entrepreneurship and related new ventures are commonly referred to as digital startups if their business logic fully relies on digital technologies for value creation and transfer (Berger et al. 2019; Steininger 2019). Such endeavors bring changes in entrepreneurial processes (e.g., opportunity recognition and pursuit), innovation, competences, control, financing, institutions, and ecosystems (Block et al. 2018b; Cram et al. 2016; Hoegen et al. 2018; Nambisan 2017; Sussan and Acs 2017; Veit et al. 2014). The analysis of innovation and its positive economic impacts have a long tradition in information systems as well as entrepreneurship research (Audretsch et al. 2006; Yoo et al. 2010). Today, digital entrepreneurship is recognized by many countries as a very important element of economic development and job creation (Block et al. 2018a). However, at the same time, it also challenges established industries and forces them to cope with these new developments and technologies that can have adverse consequences on the economy and society (Shen et al. 2018; Veit et al. 2014).\n      This special issue focuses on understanding digital entrepreneurship and its implications. Specifically, we encourage contributions that deal with the opportunities and challenges of digitalization for entrepreneurial endeavors, specificities of processes in digital startups and for developing digital business models, and the impacts on cities, regions, or countries.\n   \n   \n      Invited Contributions\n      Submissions to this special issue are encouraged from all theoretical and methodological perspectives drawing from information systems, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, strategic management, and others.

Entrepreneurs are using digital technologies to finance innovation (Ahrens et al. 2019; Audretsch et al. 2016; Fisch 2019) or create new digital products, services, and business models. These activities are called digital entrepreneurship and related new ventures are commonly referred to as digital startups if their business logic fully relies on digital technologies for value creation and transfer (Berger et al. 2019; Steininger 2019). Such endeavors bring changes in entrepreneurial processes (e.g., opportunity recognition and pursuit), innovation, competences, control, financing, institutions, and ecosystems (Block et al. 2018b; Cram et al. 2016; Hoegen et al. 2018; Nambisan 2017; Sussan and Acs 2017; Veit et al. 2014). The analysis of innovation and its positive economic impacts have a long tradition in information systems as well as entrepreneurship research (Audretsch et al. 2006; Yoo et al. 2010). Today, digital entrepreneurship is recognized by many countries as a very important element of economic development and job creation (Block et al. 2018a). However, at the same time, it also challenges established industries and forces them to cope with these new developments and technologies that can have adverse consequences on the economy and society (Shen et al. 2018; Veit et al. 2014).\n      This special issue focuses on understanding digital entrepreneurship and its implications. Specifically, we encourage contributions that deal with the opportunities and challenges of digitalization for entrepreneurial endeavors, specificities of processes in digital startups and for developing digital business models, and the impacts on cities, regions, or countries.\n   \n   \n      Invited Contributions\n      Submissions to this special issue are encouraged from all theoretical and methodological perspectives drawing from information systems, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, strategic management, and others. Authors must clearly outline why their study is new and interesting for research and practice and how it relates to the theme of the special issue.\n      The following list of topics is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.
